Adélie Penguins
==

Adélie Penguins are one of the two most famous species of penguins in Antarctica, together with the Emperor Penguins (*Aptenodytes forsteri*). Although the two species dwell in the same habitat, they do have subtle differences in their appearance, genetics, and process of evolution.

According to its [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_penguin):
>The **Adélie penguin** (*Pygoscelis adeliae*) is a species of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast, which is their only residence. They are among the most southerly distributed of all seabirds.

Adélie penguins are relatively sensitive to changes in temperature, meaning that they migrate often in the glaciers of Antarctica, and thus serve as a kind of barometer of the continent for researchers. The Adélie Penguins are also known to have a somewhat unstable population, per an NBC article, [Penguin Genomes Reveal Clues About Their Past and Future](http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/penguin-genomes-reveal-clues-about-their-past-future-n266811):
>The genetic record indicates that the Adelie penguin population increased rapidly about 150,000 years ago, when the climate became warmer. The population then dropped by 40 percent about 60,000 years ago, during a cold and dry glacial period. 

These Penguins are relatively mid-sized penguins, at about 18-20 inches in height. They can be spotted by their white eye-ring, feathers at the end of their bill, and a slightly longer tail than other penguins, overall making them look like they're wearing a tuxedo.

## Questions

* What distinguishes an Adélie Penguin's genome from the ones of common birds?

* Which birds are Adélie Penguins most similar to?

By answering these questions, I also hope to solve the puzzle of Adélie Penguins' ancestry:

 * What species did Adélie Penguins originate from?

Lastly, I'd like to investigate the differences between the genomes of Adélie Penguins and Emperor Penguins, as well as understand how they have come to evolve differently, and perhaps how recent climate change would affect the scarse population of the Adélie Penguins.
