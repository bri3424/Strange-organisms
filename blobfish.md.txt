#What is a blobfish

The specefic species blobfish I am studying is Psychrolutes marcidus (hereafter reffered to as P. Marcidus).

P. Marcidius is made from a jellylike substance which is less dense than water, allowing it to float just above 
the water.
 
P. Marcidus lives on the coasts of Tasmania and mainland Australia[1], with a depth range from 600 - 1200 m[1][2].
