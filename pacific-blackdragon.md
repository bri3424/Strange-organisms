## Questions
* How did they evolve to get so black?
* Why is there such extreme sexual dimorphism?
* What are they related to? 
## Answerable with genetics?
* Evolution can be answered partially with genetics, but a larger perspective on their environments and competitors is needed to understand the motivation behind such a change. 
* Sexual dimorphism happens both because of genetics and environment. 
* Relatives can easily be found using the tree of life, which is constructed by comparing genetic information between organisms.
