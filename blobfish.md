#What is a blobfish

The specefic species blobfish I am studying is Psychrolutes marcidus (hereafter reffered to as P. Marcidus).

P. Marcidius is made from a jellylike substance which is less dense than water, allowing it to float just above 
the water.[1]
 
P. Marcidus lives on the coasts of Tasmania and mainland Australia[1], with a depth range from 600 - 1200 m[1][2].

Given that P. Marcidius has a c-value of 0.9[3], I have estimated the value of sequencing P. Marcidius to be equal
to $2,656.00.[4]
