# What is a blobfish

The specific species of blobfish I am studying is Psychrolutes marcidus (hereafter refered to as P. Marcidus).

P. Marcidius is made from a jellylike substance which is less dense than water, allowing it to float just above 
the water.<sup>[[1]][[2]]</sup> Because of the deep sea pressures, an air bag would be inefficient.<sup>[[1]]</sup>
 
P. Marcidus lives on the coasts of Tasmania and mainland Australia, with a depth range from 600 - 1200 m.<sup>[[1]][[2]]</sup>

Given that P. Marcidius has a C-value of 0.9<sup>[[3]]</sup>, I have estimated the value of sequencing P. Marcidius to be equal to 
$9,401.00.<sup>[[4]]</sup> The parameters I used was Large insert library for Pacbio Sequel(15kb-20kb) for library preparation, and 
PacBio Sequel Sequencing(4 smrtcells) * 2.
