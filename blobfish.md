# What is a blobfish

The specific species of blobfish I am studying is Psychrolutes marcidus (hereafter refered to as P. Marcidus).

P. Marcidius is made from a jellylike substance which is less dense than water, allowing it to float just above 
the water[1][2]. Because of the deep sea pressures, an air bag would be inefficient[1]
 
P. Marcidus lives on the coasts of Tasmania and mainland Australia[1], with a depth range from 600 - 1200 m[1][2].

Given that P. Marcidius has a C-value of 0.9[3], I have estimated the value of sequencing P. Marcidius to be equal
to $2,925.00[4] (2 PacBio smart cells).
