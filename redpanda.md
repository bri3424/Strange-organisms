# Red panda

### Here are some of the coverage ratios:

###### (B is for Billion)
#### Illumina - 3B X 70 = 210B Volume
#### Pacbio – 3B X 30 = 90B Volume
#### Sanger – 3B X 10 = 30B Volume

### Cost and Smart cells:
###### Using the SQL method, the number of nucleotides per smart cell is around 5 billion.
###### The price per smart cell is $1000.

### Illumina 210 Billion Volume
### 210 B / 5 B = 42 smart cells
### 42 X 1000 = $42,000 

### PacBio 90 Billion Volume
### 90 B / 5 B = 18 smart cells
### 18 X 1000 = $18,000

### Sanger 30 Billion Volume
### 30 B / 5 B = 6 smart cells
### 6 X 1000 = $6,000


### The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
### It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is slightly larger than a domestic cat.
### It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects.
### It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.
### The red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae.
### It has been previously placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, which is part of the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Two subspecies are recognized.
### It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.
