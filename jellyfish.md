Jellyfish
========

According to its [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish):
> Jellyfish or jellies are softbodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles. The bell can pulsate to acquire propulsion and locomotion. The tentacles may be utilized to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting. Jellyfish species are classified in the subphylum Medusozoa which makes up a major part of the phylum Cnidaria, although not all Medusozoa species are considered to be jellyfish.


Questions
--------
#### How similar are the "brains" of jellyfish to the brains of other sea creatures?  

Information on the jellyfish "brain":
>Jellyfish employ a loose network of nerves, located in the epidermis, which is called a "nerve net". Although traditionally thought not to have a central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species. A jellyfish detects various stimuli including the touch of other animals via this nerve net, which then transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, through the rhopalial lappet, located at the rim of the jellyfish body, to other nerve cells.

#### How does the diversity (mainly characterized in its variation in color and shape) of jellyfish allow them to better survive in the deep sea?

**A Flower Hat Jelly:**

Although these two jellies are part of the same family, they are very *very* distinct in appearance.

### Moon Jelly (*Aurelia aurita*)

The Moon Jelly is a common jelly that is found throughout most of the world's oceans.
> The jellyfish is translucent, usually about 25–40 cm (10–16 in) in diameter, and can be recognized by its four horseshoe-shaped gonads, easily seen through the top of the bell. It feeds by collecting medusae, plankton, and mollusks with its tentacles, and bringing them into its body for digestion. It is capable of only limited motion, and drifts with the current, even when swimming.

The moon jelly has around 730 megabases in its genome. It would take around 3 SMRT cells to fully sequence a moon jelly's genome which would cost about 3000 dollars in total.

One specific jellyfish called the Box Jellyfish has 8 billion nucleotides in its genome. Reading the genome with illumina requires 40000000 reads.
