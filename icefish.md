### Question:
##### 1. How do ice fish survive without hemoglobin? 
##### 2. How can their transparent properties be related to zebrafish?
##### 3. How can its' properties serve as evolutionary models for human anemias?

##### [Complete mitochondrial genome of the Antarctic icefish](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/19401736.2013.861444?journalCode=imdn20)
### The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the Antarctic icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus was determined to be 17311 bp in length, and to contain 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes. The total A + T content is 52.8%. The notothenioid-exclusive ND6/tRNAGlu translocation was observed in the mitogenome of C. aceratus. Generally, the order and contents of the other genes are identical with those of other fishes. Antarctic icefishes, the only vertebrates which do not have hemoglobins, have evolved to survive sub-freezing temperature. Therefore, the whole mitogenome sequences of C. aceratus will provide the insights into resolving the evolutionary history of icefish.
##### [Draft genome sequence and annotation for N. coriiceps](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0468-1)
### We provide the draft genome sequence and annotation for N. coriiceps. Comparative genome-wide analysis with other fish genomes shows that mitochondrial proteins and hemoglobin evolved rapidly. Transcriptome analysis of thermal stress responses find alternative response mechanisms for evolution strategies in a cold environment. Loss of the phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif in heat shock factor 1 suggests that the heat shock response evolved into a simple and rapid phosphorylation-independent regulatory mechanism. Rapidly evolved hemoglobin and the induction of a heat shock response in the blood may support the efficient supply of oxygen to cold-adapted mitochondria.
##### [Transcriptomics and Comparative Analysis of Three Antarctic Notothenioid Fishes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3420891/)
### The transcriptomes of the Antarctic fishes Notothenia coriiceps, Chaenocephalus aceratus, and Pleuragramma antarcticum were obtained by 454 FLX Titanium sequencing of a normalized cDNA library. More than 1,900,000 reads were assembled in a total of 71,539 contigs. Overall, 40% of the contigs were annotated based on similarity to known protein or nucleotide sequences, and more than 50% of the predicted transcripts were validated as full-length or putative full-length cDNAs. These three Antarctic fishes shared 663 genes expressed in the brain and 1,557 genes expressed in the liver. In addition, these cold-adapted fish expressed more Ub-conjugated proteins compared to temperate fish; Ub-conjugated proteins are involved in maintaining proteins in their native state in the cold and thermally stable Antarctic environments. Our transcriptome analysis of Antarctic notothenioid fish provides an archive for future studies in molecular mechanisms of fundamental genetic questions, and can be used in evolution studies comparing other fish.
